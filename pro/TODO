* Measure gain + read noise

* Make bad pixel mask

* Look at the bias frames

* The b1 CCD has too much overscan subtracted on rows 0 and 1.
  Check all overscan regions in SDSSPROC.

* CR zapping.

* Need some logic to make certain we're looking at a flat, arc, etc.

* Need fiber-to-fiber flat-fielding, and flatten out any global variations,
  such as low-response zones on the CCD.

* Eschelle spectrum of sky for cross-correlating sky fibers to absolute
  wavelengths.

* Echelle spectrum of A,B bands for their removal.

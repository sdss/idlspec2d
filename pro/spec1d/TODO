* For PCA_SOLVE, trim to desired wavelength range before solving.

* For eigenspectra, save a 2nd HDU which is the remaining inverse-variance.

* Final correlation coeff should be computed with same wavelength-range
  for template, and masked + apodized the same as the object spectrum.

* Minimize reduced chi2 instead of chi2 ?

* Still need to compute errors in redshift, but how?

* Look at the e1/e0, e2,e0 values for the galaxies.

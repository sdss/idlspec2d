Description of the files

The information is pulled simply from the 2MASS files supplied to me
by Jill Knapp.  The astrometry is directly from 2MASS; no proper
motions have been applied.  We assume epoch 1998 for purposes of reading
Tycho positions at the same epoch.

For objects NOT drawn from a membership list, only those 
with an optical counterpart in the 2MASS catalog were considered.

In most cases, I think that the priority should be 
	bright stars + Hipparcos supplement
	members
	fainter stars

However, NGC 1817 is the exception.  There the priority should be:
	members
	other stars (and not super-bright)

PRAESEPE
TILEID 9207 - 9209
PLATEID 798,798B,798C,(798D for spectrophoto)

Praesepe:  We're missing a small band of data near RA=129.5.

Plate center: RA=130, dec = 19.6

Scott Burles found a membership list from Wang et al 1995.
This gave 88 matches (1") to 2MASS at J>10.  File: praesepe.match

I then took all stars with J<10 on the plate.  This gave 215 stars.  
File: praesepe.j10

I then took all stars with 10<J<13, downweighting by  
(d<0.5?1:(d/0.5)**-2), where d is the distance from the plate center.
This gave 531 more stars, but I forgot to remove the members, so there
will be ~450 new stars.  File: praesepe.j13

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PLEIADES
TILEID 9210 - 9214
PLATEID 799,799B,799C,799D,799E,(799F for spectrophoto)

Pleiades: We're missing a lot of data: the quadrant at ra<56.5 and dec>24,
plus another patch at dec>24, 58<ra<58.6, plus a couple strips.
I moved the plate center a bit to avoid these: ra = 57.0, dec = 23.7.

Also, the brightest stars (V<5.5 or so) seem to be missing from 2MASS; 
we'll have to add them in from Hipparcos.

The Pleiades is big enough that the clustering on the plate won't be
much of a problem.

I take all stars with J<10.  This gave 255 stars.  File: pleiades.j10

I then take all stars with J<14, downweighting by (J<11?1:0.15*(15-J))
(not that this is not continuous at J=11, but I needed to downweight the
fainter stars somewhat).  This gave 1113 stars.  File: pleiades.j14.

I don't seem to have a membership catalog handy, but I think that the
density of members is so high that we won't care.

Note that the nebulousity may affect our sky subtraction!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
N752
TILEID 9215 - 9217
PLATEID 800,800B,800C,(800D for spectrophoto)

N752:  We are missing data at RA>30 (and a small band at 27.8ish), so I 
moved the plate center off the cluster center a bit.

Plate center: ra = 29.25, dec = 37.68

Scott Burles found a membership list from Daniel et al 1994.
This gave 98 matches (1") to 2MASS at J>10.  File: n752.match

I then took all stars with J<10 on the plate.  This gave 238 stars.  
File: n752.j10

I then took all stars with 10<J<14 that were not members, downweighting
by  (d<0.5?1:(d/0.5)**-2) * (J<11?1:0.25*(15-J), where d is the distance
from the cluster center (RA=29.45, dec=37.68, not the plate center).
This gave 647 more stars.  File: n752.j14

The priorities here should be j10, match, and finally j14.
Also, the Hipparcos catalog will have some extra bright stars that 
we didn't have 2Mass data for.  We should have room to add them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
N1817
TILEID 9218 - 9221
PLATEID 801,801B,801C,801D,(801E for spectrophoto)

N1817:  This cluster is closer to the galactic plane and further away, 
hence the contamination by field stars is worse.  This leads to special
instructions as regards priorities and bright limits!
Don't include Tycho/Hipparcos stars.

Fortunately, Scott Burles found a membership list from Balaguer-Nunnez 
et al 1998.  I took objects whose P_field was less than 0.5.  Matching (1") 
to 2MASS gave 478 stars, highly concentrated toward the center of the field.
WE SHOULD GIVE THESE STARS HIGHEST PRIORITY.  File: n1817.match

To fill out the plate, I took stars with 8 < J < 11, downweighting the
fainter stars by the probability (J<9?1:0.25*(13-J)).  This gives 538
stars (that weren't member matchs), which are not strongly clustered to the 
center of the plate.  Chances are that most of these stars are not cluster 
members, and moreover there is probably no room at the center of the plate 
for any more objects.  File: n1817.j11

Note that these stars are *not* as bright as for other clusters.  We 
probably want a bright limit of about 8th mag.  There is no point in
including brighter field stars if they simply require another pointing.

There were no serious data gaps in this field.
Plate center: RA = 78.03, dec = 16.70

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

M67: We have some data for this, but we've decided to observe the existing
plate, number 321, rather than re-drill.

We probably need some fresh observing instructions for this plate.

h/chi Persei: No 2MASS data available yet.  We haven't tried to solve the
astrometry for Eva's UBVI photometry.

Using the IDL code to subtract OH residuals from SDSS spectra
-------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------

Please report bugs!
-------------------
This code has been tested on most obvious things, but I'm sure I
forgot something. Just send me an email: vwild@MPA-Garching.MPG.DE, or if I've
moved on try: vivienne.wild@physics.org 

Further help
------------
This code and instructions will hopefully get you started, however
please do not hesitate to contact me for help.

Acknowledge the code
--------------------
If you publish work that makes use of the code, please acknowledge it
and reference the accompanying paper!


FILES
-----
This package contains the following data files and programs:

subtractoh.pro     -> main procedure for removing sky features.
runsubtract.pro    -> example program to run subtractoh.pro

** Subsidiary functions and programs:
masklines.pro      -> masks line features
masklinesqso.pro   -> masks qso line features (broad lines treated differently)
getweights.pro     -> collect median error array for given plate (up
to DR3)
medfilt.pro        -> median filter

** Data files (GUNZIP them):
espec_OH.sav       -> idl save format, eigen-spectra of OH residuals etc:
                      espec, lambda, pix_sky, pix_nosky

plate_weights.sav  -> idl save format, weights for all plates in DR3:
                      plateerror, continuum, plateid

absgal_lines.dat   -> suggested line masks for absorption line objects
emgal_lines.dat    -> suggested line masks for emission line objects
extgal_lines.dat   -> suggested line masks for extreme emission objects
dla_lines.dat      -> some examples of DLA metal lines

** Examples
/newfiles          -> folder containing fits files of some example
		      galaxies. Compare them to your standard SDSS
		      files to see the difference.

This code requires IDL astro routines: http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html

NOTES
-----

** To get started in subtractoh.pro:
-You will need to change DIR = '' to the path of the directory in which
you have stored the above data files, if they are not in the same directory as
you are running IDL in. 
-Gunzip .sav files. 
-Also change the directory /newfiles to a directory where you want the
new files to land - /newfiles is included in the tarball containing
some example fits files and will not be overwritten unless you specify
in the code (keyword OVERWRITE to function FILE_COPY - IF YOU USE THIS
BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERWRITE YOUR STANDARD SDSS DATAFILES!!!!).

** Very basic IDL help:
If you have not used IDL before - check it is on the system, and get
someone to give you their startup file with directory routes in. This
code uses standard routines and also IDLastro routines
(http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html). 
Start IDL by typing IDL at the command line. At
the IDL> prompt type runsubtract, and return. This will make a
postscript file called runsubtract.ps with some plots in.

** Examples:
See the file runsubtract.pro or header of subtractoh.pro for an example function to
immediately reduce SDSS galaxy spectra from spSpec-mmmmm-pppp-fff.fit files. Also
read the header for possible keywords.  

** QSOs:
Note the need to specify if your object is a QSO using /QSO keyword (this
effects the way in which the masking of broad lines is carried out,
by whether the filter is applied before or after masking).

** Masking lines:
It is important to ensure that lines intrinsic to the object are
masked properly. Please check! Otherwise the code could try to remove
them. 

** Extreme emission line galaxies:
If your objects are extreme emission line galaxies you might wish to
specify this by setting the applicable keyword - this makes use of a
special line file.

** Sanity checks:
Check the following output for potential problems:
NRECON = no. of components used during reconstruction. If this reaches
the maximum set (currently 150 for galaxies and stars and 200 for
QSOs) it's worth checking to see if something has gone
wrong (e.g. problems with strong metal abs lines in
QSOs). Alternatively it's just a bad spectrum.

If you have no special requirements you can procede with this. 

Things you might like to / need to try 
--------------------------------------

1) Use an extra file of lines to mask (e.g. previously located metal
   absorption line sytems). See optional inputs LINEFILE_SEC, ZSEC.

2) Use a different line file to the default ones. Follow the format of
   the supplied files. 

3) Change the median filter size for removing the continuum of the
   object. See optional input FILTER, and accompanying paper for discussion
   of choice.

4) SPEED THINGS UP - read in eigenspectra once for all spectra. See
   keyword CB1. Read in weights once for all spectra. See optional
   input WEIGHTS

5) Make some plots of the process. See keyword PLOTSPEC.

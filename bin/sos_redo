# Script to retry Son-of-Spectro jobs.
#
# Example: Retry reductions for exposure #12551:
#   sos_redo expnum=12551
# Example: Retry reductions for plate 328:
#   sos_redo plate=328
# Example: Retry reductions for plate 328 on the remote machine "sos":
#   sos_redo sos plate=328
# Example: Retry reductions for plate 328 on MJD 51234:
#   sos_redo plate=328 mjd=51234
# (This last example will only work if the SOS reductions have not been
# removed from disk, which is usually done by a cron job each morning.)
#
# This script will not run if it looks like it is already running.
#
# In detail, if there is an argument on the command-line not of the
# form "a=b", then we assume that is the name of a remote machine and
# execute the rest of the command on that remote machine.  All other
# arguments are passed to the IDL procedure REMOVE2REDO; the last example
# above would result in the following begin executed:
#   echo "remove2redo,plate=328" | idl

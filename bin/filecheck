filecheck:

filecheck checks some attribute of a file and returns "true" or "false" based
on if the attribute is...  true or false.

This file it pretty much a grab bag of hacks.  To do these tests correctly would
either require adding dependencies just for these simple tests or duplicating lots
of code.  

The input files can be either normal or gz files.

v4_7_2 (Apr 27, 2001)

PLATELIST: Use the "spPlateList.par" file to determine which data are public.
           Add a PUB column to denote if a plate is in a public data release.
PLATEMERGE: Add the /PUBLIC option to trim only to public data.

More updates to "opHdrFix.par" file.
Makefile in /bin did not copy all executables when installing; now it does.
Update the batch files to use the wire machines as a default.
Update spectro home page to reflect v4_7 reductions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v4_7_1 (Apr 9, 2001)

FILTER_THRU: Add new Doi filter curves (CCD+atmosphere+telescope), and
             add /TOAIR flag to convert from vacuum to air wavelengths.
             (But not yet called by 2D or 1D).
PCA_SOLVE, COMPUTECHI2: Make robust to one or all of the template spectra
              (e.g., the STARFLUX vectors) being identically zero.
              The routine PCA_SOLVE could crash w/out special-casing this
              due to an apparent bug in the built-in routine PCOMP().
SPCOMBINE, SPCOADD_FRAMES: Optionally allow spFrame files to be g-zipped.
READSPEC, SPREDUCE1D: Allow spPlate, spZ files to be g-zipped.
READSPEC: Major changes to speed up the code when reading a sparse number
          of fibers per plate.  It used to read all the fibers between the
          smallest and largest fiber number.  Now it divides up the requested
          fibers into contiguous chunks, and reads in only those chunks.
          (The plate file is still only opened once, and the header is only
          read once.)

Add new mask bit: NEARWHOPPER.  This effects the following routines:
              EXTRACT_OBJECT, FLUXCORR_NEW, MYFLUXCALIB, TELLURIC_CORR.
              These fibers are also implicitly ignored by sky-subtraction
              because the sky-fiber selection implicitly assumes all fiber-
              mask bits are fatal (in EXTRACT_OBJECT).

Son-of-Spectro changes:
New executable, "sos_redo" to re-run SOS on failed reductions.
APO_APPENDLOG: Now overwrite entries in the file "logfile-$MJD.fits" if an
              exposure is re-reduced (e.g., with "sos_redo").
APO_LOG2HTML: Placed a lower limit of (S/N)^2 > 2.0 to count towards total
              in each camera
QUICKEXTRACT: Change message about post-cabibs from "REQUIRED" to merely
              "recommended."
              Slightly loosened constraints on match_trace to +/- 0.15 pixels.
QUICKTRACE: Tweak test for putative Argon lines in flats to be a less
            sensitive trigger.
REMOVE2REDO: (New proc) Checks for missing entries in logfile*fits and
            removes corresponding raw data; called by script "sos_redo".
The routine FIND_WHOPPING is moved out of EXTRACT_OBJECT so that it can
            be called by QUICKEXTRACT.
Changed SOS signal-to-noise warning to a yellow warning below S/N=15/pix,
            and S/N=13/pix.
More entries in "opHdrFix.par" to fix all the incorrect plugmap files
            known to date.  However, we still need to get the correct
            files copied into the /astrolog directories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v4_7_0 (Mar 16, 2001)

FLUXCORR_NEW: Replace deviant fluxcorr coefficients with the median
              Attempt to mask large positive deviations in inverse variance
              (PR #2040) 
SPCOMBINE:    combinedir is now a keyword for spcoadd_frames.
              SPFLUX and SPCOADD_FRAMES utilize directory keywords as well.
              Start by zeroing-out the 4 mask bits set by combining step.
FIBERFLAT:     Simple check to exclude extrema  (PR #2123)
COMBINE1FIBER: Replace the lines which errantly set NODATA with a check for the
               extrema wavelengths which have no signal. (PR #1939)
SPPLANCOMB, 
SPALLCOMBINE:  Fixed Bug to combine a specific MJD

BSPLINE_ITERFIT (in idlutils): Modified to avoid crashing SPREDUCE1D.
   Two changes: (1) Return a valid solution even in the case where the variance
   of the y-vector is zero.  (2) In the case where there are too few points to
   fit, still return a valid solution of all zeros.
FINDSPEC: New routine for finding SDSS spectra that match a given RA, DEC.
MULTISYNTHSPEC: New routine that is sometimes faster than SYNTHSPEC, but
           I would not recommend using this yet.
MYFLUXCALIB: Make robust to degenerate case of only 1 input spectro-photo std.
PLATELIST: Lower (S/N)^2 cutoff to 13 for all G,I bands (from 15 previously).
           If ZWARNING flag exists in 1D outputs, use that to determine
           number of UNKNOWN or SKY identifications.
PLOTSPEC: Add ZNUM option (also new to READSPEC).
READSPEC: Add option to generate the synthetic spectra.
          Add ZNUM option to get fits other than the best fit.
REDMONSTER: New routine for looking for Red Monster (large regions of
            bad sky residuals, which, for example happens when the hand-paddle
            light is on at the telescope).  Flag these pixels with the
            REDMONSTER mask bit.  This routine replaces MONSTER.
SPREDUCE1D: Search for stars at velocities to +/- 1200 km/s (was 600 km/s).
            No longer identify objects as UNKNOWN, but rather set bits
              in a ZWARNING flag.
            Add outputs ZWARNING, SN_MEDIAN, FRACNSIGMA,
              COUNTS_SPECTRO, COUNTS_SYNTH, COUNTS_SKY (not used yet),
              VDISP, VDISP_ERR, ANYANDMASK, ANYORMASK.
            Compute velocity dispersions using real-space method (VDISPFIT).
            Slightly increase width for re-fitting galaxy redshifts from
              PWIDTH=5 to 7.  This may fix PR #1938.
            Speed up computation of FRACNSIGMA by calling FILTER_THRU()
              for the whole plate at once.
            Output SYNFLUX as a 2nd HDU in the spZbest*.fits file.
SYNTHSPEC: Calling sequence now allows for returning an array of spectra.
TELLURIC_CORR: If a telluric star is deemded bad, then reject all of
            its FITFLUX pixels from the global fit.  Previously, we were
            only rejecting the pixels INDT, but still allowing bad continuum
            pixels into the fit.  This fixes PR #2028.
YANNY_PAR (in idlutils): If several lines have the same keyword name,
            then return all of those values as an array.  This makes this
            routine backwards-compatable with Yanny files written previously
            with SPPLAN2D.
ZFIND: Get rid of SIGMA2,SIGMA2_ERR and add VDISP,VDISP_ERR.

Add new mask bits: BADSKYCHI, REDMONSTER, SMEARIMAGE, SMEARHIGHSN, SMEARMEDSN.

New installation script "evilinstall" in the idlutils product.

Add a line to the cron tables from "sos_start" and "sprobot_start" to
keep the disk auto-mount points alive at Princeton (or anywhere using an
amd daemon).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v4_6_2 (Feb 14, 2001)

For the Fermi calling script SPALLREDUCE, add an NCOMBINE keyword
to limit the number of exposures combined.  Default to a maximum of 7.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v4_6_1 (Feb 14, 2001)

SPCOMBINE: Reverting to adderr=0.03 to prevent rejections in high S/N regions
SKYSUBTRACT: The "fix" in the previous version didn't properly check the
             bad mask bits, and in fact could make things worse.  Now fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v4_6_0 (Feb 9, 2001)

EXTRACT_OBJECT: Reverted to Gaussian Profile, more robust flat field 
                 interpolation, still 3% are fluctuations when 
                 NEARBADPIXEL is set.
FIBERFLAT: Fiber is flagged BADFLAT is more than 30% of pixels are masked.
FLATINTERP: Remove call to this code.
SPCALIB: Back to original flat field rejection levels matches object extraction.
SKYSUBTRACT: Check for NEARBADPIXEL and LOWFLAT bit as well in pixelmask.

Add BADFLUXFACTOR mask bit when applying flux-calibration and flux-correction
vectors.

Fixed DJS_BATCH to work properly on remote but cross-mounted CPU's.

Plan files (spPlancomb*.par) written by SPPLAN1D now puts all the "planfile2d"
entries on the same line to be consistent with how YANNY_PAR() works now.

Fix the spike in memory usage at the end of SPCOMBINE.

Major changes to PLATELIST routine to return more info, and make a FITS
binary table.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v4_5_0 (Jan 31, 2001)

Edits to raw frame headers now possible with SPHDRFIX procedure, which
reads the list of changes from opHdrFix.par file.  In particular, this
allows us to edit wrong headers in some of the earliest data.

The F-star flux-calibration vectors are generated with a PCA analysis
that now allows several rejection iterations.

More iterations added to the arc-line centroiding in FITARCIMAGE
(addresses PR #874).

Son-of-Spectro now tests for the Red Monster (light at 6400-6550 Ang in
science frames), and tests for argon lines in the flat-fields.  The Red
Monster is presumably from the handpaddle being left plugged in.

SPREDUCE1D: If an object is fit by a negative STAR or negative QSO, then
            re-classify it as UNKNOWN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v4_4_0 (Jan 23, 2001)

Remove any telluric-correction beyond 8250 Ang, since we don't believe
any of it there.  In fact, it looks like we were multiplying-in features
that are F-star absorption lines at 8540 and 8660 Ang.  But what about
the broad feature at 8665 Ang -- is that a telluric-band, or an intrinsic
F-star feature??

Keyword CARTID added to headers to track cartridge ID's.

Spectro robot scripts included in /bin directory (sprobot_start, etc.)

For Son-of-Spectro, the WARNING and ABORT messages are now saved in HDU #5
of the FITS log file, rather than as an element of the other HDU's.

For Son-of-Spectro, now only copies astrolog directory of existing
/data/spectro/$MJD data directory, since from now on the astrolog directory
will never be purged.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v4_3_1 (Dec 10, 2000)

This version of "idlspec2d" has the following enhancements for
Son-of-Spectro (SOS):

(1) The hard-wired user/machine/version dependencies have been removed.
    SOS can now be run by any user on any machine, which we may want to
    do to avoid conflicts with the fiber-mapper.  Though for now, this
    will continue to be run from "observer@plate-mapper".
(2) Starting+stopping SOS is now done with the commands
       sos_start
       sos_status
       sos_stop
    which will start-up whichever version of the code has been either
    declared or set up.  Backing out of versions is now straight-forward.
(3) The code can now be managed remotely.  For example, from "sdsshost"
    you can type:
       setup idlspec2d
       sos_status observer@plate-mapper
    to check the status of SOS.
(4) SOS delays execution when the fiber-mapper is being run.
(5) More logging information is kept.
(6) Identified and removed Y2022 bugs which would have stopped SOS from
    working at MJD=60000.  It should now work until the year 2132.
(6) Documentation is now complete, and updated to reflect all above changes.
    The relevant documentation is also in the "sdssProcedures" product.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v4_3_0 (Dec 6, 2000)

The changes are primarily to the Son-of-Spectro (SoS) code, specifically:

(1) The FITS log files have been re-structured to significantly speed
    up reading these files.  This was the bottleneck that slowed SoS
    down towards the end of a night, since each instance of reading these
    files locked out other processes.  Our hope is that now SoS will
    keep up during the night.
(2) Bias and dark exposures are now analyzed, and the 98th percentile
    of all values in these images are reported to SoS.  For example,
    if 98% of the pixels in a bias are below 8 ADU, then PERCENTILE98 = 8.
(3) The operational limits file has been edited so that SoS values
    that appear in red should definitely be considered very bad.
    For example, if the number of arc lines found (NLAMPS) is red, then
    that arc exposure should be considered bad and another should be
    taken until a good number are found.
      In practice, we expect it to be rare that anything falls out of spec.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v4_2_0 (Nov 28, 2000?)

1)  Skip low S/N smear images in flux correction (previously aborted)

2)  Added bad columns to opBC.par

3)  Fixed bug in sdssproc when dealing with shifted rows between
    MJD 51578 AND 51580 inclusive.

4)  Changed structure of spMerge2d to have [flux,err] as image
    in HDU 0, and [andmask, ormask, dispersion] as binary table in HDU 1.

5)  Added headers cards to HDU's 1-5 in spPlate*fits to include wavelength
    information.

6)  Fixed bug to work on sdR*gz files.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v4_1_0 (Oct 20, 2000?)

The following lists the highlights/lowlights
of the new 2d version:

Here is a catalog of the raw 2d output:

    spFrame-cc-xxxxxxxx.fits       Object Frame extraction

        HDU0 :  "Flattened" counts per pixel   Float 2048x320
        HDU1 :  Inverse variance of HDU0       Float 2048x320
        HDU2 :  Pixelmask (see below)          Long  2048x320
        HDU3 :  Wavelength coefficients        Structure
        HDU4 :  Dispersion coefficients        Structure
        HDU5 :  plPlugMapP for 320 fibers      Structure
        HDU6 :  Telluric correction image      Float 2048x320  (only for red)

    spSky-cc-xxxxxxxx.fits    2048x320  Subtracted sky image
    spFlat-cc-xxxxxxxx.fits   2048x320  flat field vectors
    spArc-cc-xxxxxxxx.fits    2048x320  Arc spectra extractions +
                                           HDU1: inverse variance
    spDiag2d-pppp-mmmmm.ps
    spDiag2d-pppp-mmmmm.log

Legend:

xxxxxxxx  Frame number
pppp      Plate number
mmmmm     MJD
cc        camera
s         spectrograph

Just before combining 2 or more exposures into fully merged spectra
we perform two flux calibration steps.   The outputs are:

    spFluxcalib-xxxxxxxx-s.fits   Bspline structure to convert 
                                  flattened counts to 10^-17 ergs/s/cm^2/A

    spFluxcorr-xxxxxxxx-s.fits    Polynomial coefficients to correct 
                                  science frames to smear frame

The final coaddition uses spFrame, spFluxcalib, and spFluxcorr to create

    spPlate-pppp-mmmmm.fits    Fully calibrated final 2d output

        HDU0 :  Fluxed log-linear spectra   Float npix x 640  where npix ~3900
                 units of 10^(-17) ergs/s/cm^2/A

        HDU1 :  Inverse variance of HDU0
        HDU2 :  Pixelmask (Intersection  aka AND mask)  LONG npix x 640
        HDU3 :  Pixelmask (Union  aka OR mask)          LONG npix x 640
        HDU4 :  Dispersion Image (sigma of arc lines)
                  in units of 1.0e-4 log10 lambda
        HDU5 :  plPlugMapP                              STRUCTURE

After the final coaddition, the data will be restructured into 
individual files, one for each fiber:

    spMerge2d-pppp-mmmmm-fff.fits   (fff is fiber number 1 through 640)
        
        HDU0 :  Flux and err      Float npix x 2
        HDU1 :  Pixelmask AND,OR  LONG  npix x 2
        HDU2 :  Dipsersion image  Float npix x 1


!!!!!Notice:  Multiple MJDs with the same plugging will be combined!!!!!
             into single outputs, but will be labeled with the 
                 highest MJD of the group.
  
             Bad data which should not be combined
             with subsequent data should be deleted before the subsequent
             data is run through 2d.

New features of v4_1_0:

  Major New Features:

    1) Spectrophotometry:
       
      a)  Flux calibrate with all available SPECTROPHOTO_STD and
          REDDEN_STD stars.  Use PCA to derive first and second
          eigenspectra.  Compare directly with SDSS Fundamentals to
          calibrate each smear exposure.  
      
      b)  Flux correct each science frame with throughput and color
          terms to match spectrophoto solution of smear image for
          each fiber.  Use SPECTROPHOTO_STD solution to low S/N fibers.

    2) Correct for Near Infrared Scattering (see msg from jeg) and
       possible optical scattering.  The scattered light background
       is estimated from a model profile of the full 2048x2048 image.

    3) New maskbits:
       
        Each individual frame extracted by 2d has the following maskbits
        possibly set for each pixel: (found in idlspec2d/etc/spMaskbits.par)

      # The following mask bits are for the fiber, set in FIBERMASK_BITS()
maskbits  0 NOPLUG          # Fiber not listed in plugmap file
maskbits  1 BADTRACE        # Bad trace from routine TRACE320CRUDE
maskbits  2 BADFLAT         # Low counts in fiberflat
maskbits  3 BADARC          # Bad arc solution
maskbits  4 MANYBADCOLUMNS  # >10% pixels are bad columns
maskbits  5 MANYREJECTED    # >10% pixels are rejected in extraction
maskbits  6 LARGESHIFT      # Large spatial shift between flat and object pos'n
maskbits  7 BADSKYFIBER     # Sky Fiber shows extreme residuals

# The following mask bits are for a pixel, set in PIXELMASK_BITS()
maskbits 16 NEARBADPIXEL    # Bad pixel within 3 pixels of trace
maskbits 17 LOWFLAT         # Flat field less than 0.5
maskbits 18 FULLREJECT      # Pixel fully rejected in extraction (INVVAR=0)
maskbits 19 PARTIALREJECT   # Some pixels rejected in extraction
maskbits 20 SCATTEREDLIGHT  # Scattered light significant
maskbits 21 CROSSTALK       # Cross-talk significant
maskbits 22 NOSKY           # Sky level unknown at this wavelength (INVVAR=0)
maskbits 23 BRIGHTSKY       # Sky level > flux + 10*(flux-error)
maskbits 24 NODATA          # No data available in combine B-spline (INVVAR=0)
maskbits 25 COMBINEREJ      # Rejected in combine B-spline

        Maskbits 0 through 7 apply to the full set of 2048 pixels on 
        blue or red spectra.

        The combined spectra found in spPlate*fits or spMerge2d*fits
        have two masks:  
          AND mask: the bit is set if all overlapping pixels is set.
          OR  mask:         "         any overlapping pixel bit is set.

Minor changes: 
     
    1) Lower limit to variance in raw image, 
       equivalent to S/N < 100 per pixel.

    2) New optimal extraction profile: 0.5 * exp(-x^2) + 0.5*exp(-|x|^3)
       (proftype 3)

    3) Restricted wavelength range in telluric correction
    
    4) Tighter rejection limits, more stringent cosmic rejection
       limits: +- 4 sigma

    5) Sign has been corrected in heliocentric velocity

    6) The header has the following changes:

         CALID*  has been deleted
         UNSIGNED has been deleted
         
         FRAMESN2    S/N^2 for each frame, does not apply to merged
                          spectra
         EXPID       can accomodate more than 10 exposures
         PIXFLAT:    2d pixel flat used
         OPBC:       bad pixel file applied
         OPECALIB:   opEcalib file applied
         OPCONFIG:   opConfig file applied

         SPEC1_G, SPEC1_R, SPEC1_I
         SPEC2_G, SPEC2_R, SPEC2_I :  Fiducial S/N across spectrographs
            
         MAG_G, MAG_R, MAG_I : Synthetic magnitude after
                               spectrophotometry

      
     7) Bspline package no longer requires slatec library

     8) Sky fibers with significant extra flux are rejected

     9) Number of bad fibers with given bits set are tabulated at end
   
    10) pipeline can run and use .fit.gz  gzipped raw data files,
        saving about 40% of space required by raw spectro data
     
    11) Spectral Resolution is output in the final merged spectra.

    12) Use a better algorithm to tweak flat field trace to match object
        trace.

    13) Fixes in to account for electronics problem in August

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v3c (May 12, 2000?)

It still requires idlutils v3b to run.
It is tagged on the branch, v3branch, and includes the following
improvements to the 2d pipeline:

- Auto-generation of S/N plot at conclusion of spectra merging.
- Increased number of supersky breakpoints to achieve better sky subtraction
- Added entries to opBC.par file, this will remove most of the remaining
  glitches.
- Added a new routine, "spmulti", which can combine multiple MJDs
  with the same plugmap file
- Heliocentric correction is now done on an exposure by exposure basis in 2d.
- Removed header cards which are no longer pertinent, and added some
  extras requested by Andy.
    Ones to note are NGOOD (number of good pixels in final spectrum)
    SN_G, SN_R, SN_I  (3 measures of S/N)
- Dispersion and spatial widths are output as a function of fiber
  fiber number & pixel (in spArcInfo and spFlatInfo respectively)

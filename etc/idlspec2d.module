# The first line of this file tells Modules that this is a module file.
# DO NOT ALTER IT!
#
# ABOUT THIS FILE
#
# This file is designed to be processed by Python.  Specifically, this file
# will be read into a string, and the .format() method will be applied to it.
# This file is not a valid module file on its own.
#
# METADATA AND DOCUMENTATION SECTION
#
# This function is part of the Modules help system.  You can modify
# the second line if needed, but most products should
# leave this alone.
#
proc ModulesHelp {{ }} {{
    global product version
    puts stderr "This module adds $product/$version to your environment."
}}
#
# These variables are used below.  The product variable should be set to
# the name of the product and never changed.  The version variable will
# be set at install time, so it should be left alone.
#
set product {name}
set version {version}
#
# The line below is another part of the Modules help system.  You can
# modify the part in quotes if you really need to, but most products should
# leave this alone.
#
module-whatis "Sets up $product/$version in your environment."
#
# DEPENDENCIES SECTION
#
# If your product requires other software to function, that should be declared
# here.  There are two types of dependencies: mandatory and optional.
# A mandatory dependency is a module load command followed by a prereq
# command.  An optional dependency is not followed by a prereq statement.
#
module load bbspec
module load dust
module load elodie
module load spinspect
module unload specflat
module load specflat/v1_25
module unload speclog
module load speclog/trunk
module load platelist
module load platedb
module load photolog/dr10
module unload idlutils
module load idlutils/v5_5_17

#
# ENVIRONMENT SECTION
#
# The PRODUCT_ROOT and PRODUCT_DIR variables are used to set other
# environment variables, exported to the actual environment, by sdss4install
#
set PRODUCT_ROOT {root}
#
# This line creates an environment variable pointing to the install
# directory of your product.
#
setenv [string toupper $product]_DIR $PRODUCT_DIR
setenv [string toupper $product]_VER $version
#
# The lines below set various other environment variables.  They assume the
# template product layout.  These will be set or commented as needed by the
# sdss4install script.

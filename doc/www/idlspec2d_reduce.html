<H1 ALIGN="center">Reducing Raw SDSS Specroscopic Data</H1>

These are the instructions for running the spectroscopic pipeline on
the raw SDSS data.  You must first <A HREF="idlspec2d_install.html">install
the IDL code</A>, which are the three products: idlspec2d, idlutils, specflat.

<HR>

<H2 ALIGN="left">The Directory Structure</H2>

<P>
The directory stucture for spectroscopic data is described by environment
variables as follows:
<DL><DD><PRE>
   $RAWDATA_DIR/<I>mmmmm</I> - The raw image, "sdR-<I>cc-eeeeeeee</I>.fit"
   $SPECLOG_DIR/<I>mmmmm</I> - The plug-map files, "plPlugMapM-<I>pppp-mmmmm-rr</I>.par"
</PRE></DD></DL>
where <I>mmmmm</I> refers to an MJD (such as 51690), <I>cc</I> refers
to a camera name (such as b1 for blue-1), <I>pppp</I> refers to a plate
number (such as 0306), <I>eeeeeeee</I> refers to an exposure number
(such as 00003974), and <I>rr</I> refers to a fiber-mapper re-run number
(such as 01).

<P>
At Princeton, these paths would be set as follows:
<DL><DD><PRE>
   setenv RAWDATA_DIR    /u/dss/rawdata
   setenv SPECLOG_DIR    /u/dss/astrolog
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
To re-run a plate through the spectro pipeline, you need all of these files.
Both paths must be set appropriately.

<H2 ALIGN="left">Obtaining the Raw Data</H2>

<P>
The raw data is available from Princeton, where we keep two copies
spinning.  The raw images for a particular night ($MJD) can be found at:
<DL><DD><PRE>
   sdssdata.princeton.edu:/u/dss/rawdata/$MJD/sdR*.fit
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
The plug-map files for a particular night ($MJD) can be found at:
<DL><DD><PRE>
   sdssdata.princeton.edu:/u/dss/astrolog/$MJD/plPlugMapM*.par
</PRE></DD></DL>
These are also available from the CVS product "speclog", though that
may be out of date by several days or weeks.


<H2 ALIGN="left">Generating Plan Files</H2>

<P>
My convention is to put the reduced data in a directory separate from
the data where the top-level directory is $SPECTRO_DATA.  At Princeton,
this would be set to
<DL><DD><PRE>
   setenv SPECTRO_DATA     /u/dss/spectro
</PRE></DD></DL>
Each plate is put in its own subdirectory, so the reductions of plate 306
would be in "/u/dss/spectro/0306".

<P>
Before running the spectro pipeline, you need to build plan files for
each plate.  Create the output directory $SPECTRO_DATA.  From there,
build the plan files...
<DL><DD><PRE>
   IDL> <A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#SPPLAN2D">spplan2d</A>
   IDL> <A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#SPPLAN1D">spplan1d</A>
</PRE></DD></DL>
This could take an hour to build plan files for all the data taken to date.
However, you can limit this to particular nights of data by setting
keywords to these procedures (see the full documentation).

<P>
The spplan2d command builds the files "spPlan2d-<I>pppp-mmmmm</I>.par".
There is one such file for each night a plate is observed.

<P>
The spplan1d command builds the files "spPlancomb-<I>pppp-mmmmm</I>.par".
This file merges exposures from multiple nights of observations of the same
plate <B>if</B> those observations were taken without re-plugging the plate.
If the plate was re-plugged between nights, then a given fiber will correspond
to different objects in each night, and those nights' data shouldn't be
combined with "spcombine".

<P>
Note that these plan files are ASCII files (in something called a Yanny
parameter format) which can be hand-edited.  That way, you can exclude
particular exposures from a reduction by commenting-out lines with hash
marks (#).

<H2 ALIGN="left">Running from the IDL Prompt</H2>

<P>
It takes approximately 3.5 hours to run one plate through Spectro-2D on
a 1-GHz Pentium-III, and another 4 hours to run Princeton-1D.

<P>
In each output plate directory, you can run the following three commands
from the IDL prompt:
<DL><DD><PRE>
   IDL> <A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#SPREDUCE2D">spreduce2d</A>
   IDL> <A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#SPCOMBINE">spcombine</A>
   IDL> <A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#SPREDUCE1D">spreduce1d</A>
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
The spreduce2d command reduces individual exposures to
"spFrame-<I>cc-eeeeeeee</I>.fits" files.

<P>
The spcombine command combines those exposures into the reduced plate
file, "spPlate-<I>pppp-mmmmm</I>.fits".

<P>
The spreduce1d command finds the redshifts, and generates the file
"spZbest-<I>pppp-mmmmm</I>.fits".

<P>
A number of other supplementary files are also produced.  The history
of the reductions are written to log files named "spDiag*.log", and
some PostScript plots are written to "spDiag*.ps".

<H2 ALIGN="left">Running in the Background</H2>

For example, to reduce plate 306 from the command line,
<DL><DD><PRE>
echo "<A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#SPREDUCE2D">spreduce2d</A>, 'spPlan2d-0306-51690.par'" | idl >& /dev/null &
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
Son-of-Spectro is a cron job that runs from the "observer" account
on "sos.apo.nmsu.edu".  It should always be running, and
should even recover (as any cron job) if that machine is power-cycled.
It has been run previously on the machines "hoggpt.apo" and
"plate-mapper.apo".

<P>
Log into "sos.apo" as user "observer".  Check if the SOS is running
by typing:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % sos_status
</PRE></DD></DL>
If it is <B>not</B> running, then you will see a response beginning with:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  The Son-of-Spectro cron job is NOT running for USER=observer MACHINE=sos.
</PRE></DD></DL>
If it <B>is</B> running, then you will see a response beginning with:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  The Son-of-Spectro cron job IS running for USER=observer MACHINE=sos.
</PRE></DD></DL>
This is then followed with some other information that may be useful
for trouble-shooting.

<P>
To start up SOS, type:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % sos_start
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
To stop up SOS, type:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % sos_stop
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
All of these commands can also be run from a remote machine.
A second argument should be the machine name with an optional user-name, i.e.:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % sos_status sos
  % sos_status observer@sos.apo.nmsu.edu
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
Note that the following directories should exist on sos.apo and be
write-able by the observer account:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  /data/spectro
  /data/spectro/astrolog
  /data/spectro/spectrologs
  /data/spectro/spectrologs/html
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
Note that the following link should exist if running on sos.apo:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  ln -s /usr/local/www/data /data/spectro/spectrologs/html
</PRE></DD></DL>
Note that the following link should exist if running on hoggpt.apo:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  ln -s /data/spectro/spectrologs/html /usrdevel/skent/inventory/www/apo2d
</PRE></DD></DL>
Note that the following link should exist if running on plate-mapper.apo:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  ln -s /data/spectro/spectrologs/html /home/skent/inventory/www/apo2d
</PRE></DD></DL>

<H2><A NAME="version">Backing out to an older version</A></H2>

<P>
The following intructions only apply to versions of "idlspec2d" v4_3_1 and later.

<P>
You can run a different version of Son-of-Spectro by setting up
the relevant version of idlspec2d before you launch it with "sos_start".
This should be done from the "observer" account on "sos.apo.nmsu.edu".
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % sos_stop
  % setup idlspec2d v4_3_1
  % sos_start
</PRE></DD></DL>
If you type "sos_status", it should tell you which version is now running.

<P>
Note that Son-of-Spectro is actually general enough to be run from any
account on any remote computer.  The only requirements are as following:
<OL>
<LI>The directory /data/spectro must exist on the remote machine,
    and be write-able by the user.
<LI>This user@machine must have permission to copy files with "ssh"
    "from sdsshost.apo.nmsu.edu".  This must be set up to work without
    typing a passphrase.
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="install">Installing a new version</A></H2>

<P>
The following intructions only apply to versions of "idlspec2d" v4_3_1 and later.

<H3><A NAME="install_evil">Installing w/evilinstall (recommended)</A></H3>

<P>
This is the short-cut to installing code using UPS.  It will cvs-export
code, build it, install it, and declare it current.  If the code is already
installed, then it simply declares it current.

<P>
First you need "evilinstall" in your path, which is part of the "idlutils"
product:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % setup idlutils
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
You will need to be using an account that has write-permission in
the products (/p) directory, such as "observer" or "products".
You will also need to be in a local directory (such as $HOME) where
you have write-permission.

<P>
Now install the code, installing first "idlutils" then "idlspec2d" to get
the dependencies right:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % evilinstall idlutils v4_7_1
  % evilinstall idlspec2d v4_7_1
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
That's it!  This should work for any survey code, not just Spectro.

<H3><A NAME="install_ups">Installing w/UPS</A></H3>

<P>
Check out a tagged version, such as v4_3_1, of both "idlutils" and "idlspec2d".
These should be checked out to your home directory, then installed in the
products directory (/p).

<OL>

<LI>
To avoid typing mistakes, I start by defining two environment variables
for the version numbers:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % setenv IDLUTILS_VERS v4_3_1
  % setenv IDLSPEC2D_VERS v4_3_1
</PRE></DD></DL>

<LI>
Install this version of "idlutils" and declare it current:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % setup sdsscvs # Only needed on machines set up by Fermi
  % setup sdsstools # (if you didn't setup sdsscvs)
  % cd
  % cvs export -r $IDLUTILS_VERS idlutils
  % cd ~/idlutils
  % setup -r ~/idlutils idlutils
  % setup sdsstools # Only needed on machines set up by Fermi
  % sdssmake -idl -opt -debug
  % setenv IDLUTILS_DIR /p/idlutils/$IDLUTILS_VERS
  % sdssmake install
  % ups declare -f Linux+2 -m idlutils.table \
    -r /p/idlutils/$IDLUTILS_VERS -c idlutils $IDLUTILS_VERS
</PRE></DD></DL>

<LI>
Install this version of "idlspec2d" with a dependency on the above
version of "idlutils", and declare it current:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % setup sdsscvs # Only needed on machines set up by Fermi
  % setup sdsstools # (if you didn't setup sdsscvs)
  % cd
  % cvs export -r $IDLSPEC2D_VERS idlspec2d
  % cd ~/idlspec2d
  % setup -r ~/idlspec2d idlspec2d
  % setup idlutils $IDLUTILS_VERS  # This makes the dependency
  % sdssmake -idl -opt -debug
  % setenv IDLSPEC2D_DIR /p/idlspec2d/$IDLSPEC2D_VERS
  % sdssmake install
  % ups declare -f Linux+2 -m idlspec2d.table \
    -r /p/idlspec2d/$IDLSPEC2D_VERS -c idlspec2d $IDLSPEC2D_VERS
</PRE></DD></DL>

</OL>

<P>
Now you are ready to <A HREF="#launch">launch</A> this new version of the code.

<H3><A NAME="install_cvs">Installing w/out UPS</A></H3>

<OL>

<LI>
IDL must already be installed on your system, and
the environment variables IDL_DIR and IDL_PATH must already be set.

<LI>
Check out a tagged version, such as v4_3_1, of both "idlutils" and "idlspec2d",
into your home directory (for this example).
To avoid typing mistakes, I start by defining two environment variables
for the version numbers:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % setenv IDLUTILS_VERS v4_3_1
  % setenv IDLSPEC2D_VERS v4_3_1
  % setup sdsscvs # Only needed on machines set up by Fermi
  % cd
  % cvs co -r $IDLUTILS_VERS idlutils
  % cvs co -r $IDLSPEC2D_VERS idlspec2d
</PRE></DD></DL>

<LI>
Set the environment variables.  From a "csh" or "tcsh" shell:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % setenv IDLUTILS_DIR $HOME/idlutils
  % setenv IDLSPEC2D_DIR $HOME/idlspec2d
  % set path=( $IDLUTILS_DIR/bin $IDLSPEC2D_DIR/bin $path )
  % setenv IDL_PATH +{$IDLUTILS_DIR}/goddard/pro:{$IDL_PATH}
  % setenv IDL_PATH +{$IDLUTILS_DIR}/pro:{$IDL_PATH}
  % setenv IDL_PATH +{$IDLSPEC2D_DIR}/pro:{$IDL_PATH}
</PRE></DD></DL>
You may wish to add the above lines to your ``~/.cshrc'' file.

<LI>
Build the code:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % setup idl # Only needed on machines set up by Fermi
  % cd $IDLUTILS_DIR
  % evilmake all
  % cd $IDSPEC2D_DIR
  % evilmake all
</PRE></DD></DL>

</OL>

<P>
Now you are ready to <A HREF="#launch">launch</A> the code.

<H2><A NAME="howwork">How Son-of-Spectro Works</A></H2>

<P>
Son-of-Spectro is a cron job that runs from the "observer" account
on "sos.apo.nmsu.edu".  This cron job invokes rsync once
every minute to copy raw spectro data from "sdsshost" to "sos.apo",
then launches a package of shell scripts and IDL commands to reduce
the data one frame at a time.  It is part of the <B>idlspec2d</B> data product.

<P>
There are actually <B>two</B> rsync processes that run, one for the blue
camera images and one for the red.  We did this so that both processors on the
computer can be utilized.  All 4 cameras should be reduced for an exposure
within a few minutes.

<P>
The raw data is copied into these directories on sos.apo:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  /data/spectro/astrolog/$MJD  - Copy of the same from sdsshost
  /data/spectro/$MJD           - Copy of /astrolog from sdsshost
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
The data reduction is not the same as the full-up spectroscopic pipeline.
A number of shortcuts are taken to speed up the reductions and make them
very robust.  For example, boxcar extraction of the spectra is used instead
of optimal extraction.

<P>
The reduced data will appear in the directory:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  /data/spectro/spectrologs/$MJD
</PRE></DD></DL>
Files like the following can be found in that directory:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  splog-b1-00006541.log              - Text history of exp #6541 reduction
  tset-51795-0389-00006541-b1.fits   - Fiber traces (from flat exposure #6541)
  wset-51795-0389-00006542-r1.fits   - Wavelength solution (from arc exp #6542)
  fflat-51795-0389-00006542-b1.fits  - Flat-field vectors (w/ arc exp #6542)
  sci-0389-b2-00006546.fits          - Science spectra for plate 389 (exp #6546)
  logfile-51795.fits                 - Summary info for night in FITS format

  snplot-51795-0389.ps               - Signal-to-noise plot for nplate 389
</PRE></DD></DL>
If a particular frame does not get reduced and appear on the Son-of-Spectro
web site, then you can look at its log file (splog*.log).  If the file
does not end with the line "Finished at", then that exposure must have
crashed.

<P>
The HTML files and S/N plots for the web page are copied into the directory:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  /data/spectro/spectrologs/html
</PRE></DD></DL>
The most recent HTML file has a second copy as the file "logfile-current.html".

<H2><A NAME="outputs">Son-of-Spectro Outputs</A></H2>

<H4><A NAME="outputs_table">Tabulated values</A></H4>

<P>
Son-of-Spectro reduces four flavors of observations:
bias/dark, flat, arc, & science/smear.  Select information is tabulated
for each of these types of observation.  These values are tabulated in
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">yellow</FONT></B>
if they are going out of spec, and in
<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">red</FONT></B>
if they are very much out of spec.

<P>
The values reported are:
<UL>
<LI><B>BIAS/DARK PERCENTILE98</B> <BR>
    The value in electrons of the 98-th percentile on the (overscan-corrected)
    image.  For example, if this is 8, then 98% of the pixels are below 8
    electrons.  Bad regions on the CCD and saturated pixels are excluded
    from this evaluation.
<LI><B>FLAT NGOODFIBER</B> <BR>
    The number of illuminated fibers.  This should be 320 if all the
    fibers are plugged and unbroken.
<LI><B>FLAT XMIN (XMAX)</B> <BR>
    The minimum (maximum) X position of the spectra on the CCD.  If this is
    less than 0 (greater than 2047), then some of the spectra fall off the
    left (right) side of the CCD.
<LI><B>ARC WAVEMIN (WAVEMAX)</B> <BR>
    The minimum (maximum) wavelength (in Angstroms) of any spectra on this CCD.
    Because of the optical distortions, this is always for the central
    fiber.  The edge fibers have less wavelength coverage.
<LI><B>ARC BESTCORR</B> <BR>
    The linear correlation coefficient between the arc spectra and a template
    arc spectrum.  If they agree perfectly, then this is 1.  The value of
    this correlation is typically 0.80.  If it drops too much lower, then
    the arc spectra do not look as they should.  This could happen if some
    of the arc lines are missing -- if, for example, the Hg lamps all failed.
    If the correlation is less than 0.5 or so, then it's even possible that
    the code has found the incorrect wavelength solution.
<LI><B>ARC NLAMPS</B> <BR>
    The number of arc lines used to generate the wavelength solution.
    There are many more on the red CCD's because neon has many more lines
    there.  If this drops to too few lines, then some of the lamps have not
    turned on properly, have not warmed up, or have warmed up too much.
<LI><B>SCIENCE/SMEAR SKY/SEC</B> <BR>
    The median sky counts in electrons per pixel.
    If this is too large, then there must be a light source near the
    telescope, or the night sky (the moon) is bright, or the CCD's are
    warming up and generating dark current.
<LI><B>SCIENCE/SMEAR (S/N)^2</B> <BR>
    The signal-to-noise squared for objects at the fiducial magnitude limit.
    We choose (S/N)^2 because it is an additive quantity with additional
    integration time.  When all the cameras reach a total (S/N)^2 of 15,
    then all these entries turn from red to black, and
    we can declare a plate done.  Exactly how this quantity is
    measured is <A HREF="#outputs_figure">described below</A>.
</UL>

<P>
The exact values of these yellow/red limits and further explanation can
be found in the "idlspec2d" product in the file "examples/opLimits.par".

<H4><A NAME="outputs_warning">WARNING and ABORT messages</A></H4>

<P>
There are a number of
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">WARNING</FONT></B>
and
<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">ABORT</FONT></B>
messages that can appear if the pipeline runs into trouble when processing
a frame.  These messages appear at the bottom of each table.
Each one-line message begins with the procedure name that encountered the
trouble, the file name that it was working on, WARNING or ABORT,
then a brief plain-text message.

<P>
The following messages may appear:
<UL>
<LI><B>Exposure number in header disagrees w/filename</B> <BR>
    This means that IOP/SOP is in a very confused state, and it
    is putting a different exposure number in the header (EXPOSURE
    keyword) from what is being used to generate file names.
    You should probably exit SOP, re-start SOP, then issue a "goStare -init".
<LI><B>Fixing shifted rows (from electronics)</B> <BR>
    This is very, very bad.  This is indicative of an electronics problem
    that we first saw on MJD=51578 to 51580 (3 to 5 Feb 2000).
    The raw images have rows shifted to the right, sometimes by
    many pixels.
<LI><B>Fixing dropped-pixel rows (from electronics)</B> <BR>
    This is very bad.  This is indicative of an electronics problem
    that we first saw on MJD=51688 (23 May 2000).
    The raw images actually have some rows shifted by 1 or 2 pixels,
    usually more so near the bottom of the CCD (the first rows to be read).
<LI><B>More than 10% of the image is rejected</B> <BR>
    This is very bad.  This can probably only happen if most of the CCD
    has saturated pixels.
<LI><B>Flat-field screens not closed</B> <BR>
    The "FFS" keyword in the header indicates that at least one of the
    flat-field petals was not closed.  When this happens, the flat or arc
    is not reduced.
<LI><B>Flat-field lamps not turned on</B> <BR>
    The "FF" keyword in the header indicates that at least one of the four
    flat-field lamps was not turned on.
    When this happens, the flat is not reduced.
<LI><B>Reject flat (or arc) ... % bad pixels</B> <BR>
    This condition is triggered when more than 2% of the non-masked pixels
    on the image are bad (saturated).
    When this happens, the flat (or arc) is not reduced.
<LI><B>Reject flat (or arc) ... saturated rows</B> <BR>
    This condition is triggered when there are more than 100 saturated rows
    on the image.
    When this happens, the flat (or arc) is not reduced.
<LI><B>Reject flat as too faint</B> <BR>
    This condition is triggered when the 80-th percentile of the image
    is less than 1000 electrons.
    When this happens, the flat is not reduced.
<LI><B>Emission lines (Argon?) in flats</B> <BR>
    Emission lines are present in the quartz-halogen flat-field images,
    which are supposed to be featureless.  We have identified these rogue
    lines as argon.  JEG's best guess is that these
    contaminating lines come from trace amounts of argon in the HgCd lamps,
    which must still have current running through them when they are supposed
    to be off.  If possible, it is much better to get flat-field exposures
    without this problem.
<LI><B>Arc lamps not turned on</B> <BR>
    The "NE" and "HGCD" keywords in the header indicates that either the
    neon or HgCd lamps are not fully turned on.
    When this happens, the arc is not reduced.
<LI><B>Best arc correlation = ...</B> <BR>
    The cross-correlation of the arc spectrum with the template arc spectrum
    was bad.  This is also triggered as BESTCORR in the table (see above).
<LI><B>Big wavelength gap</B> <BR>
    Some arc lines were not found in the arc spectra, and there is a large
    gap in wavelength space without any lines.  This will produce a poor
    wavelength solution.  More arcs should be taken until this message
    does not appear.
<LI><B>Scattered light</B> <BR>
    There was a high baseline count rate on the CCD, and appears even
    between fibers.  This can most obviously occur if there are light
    sources in the CCD (such as the LED's we had for some time), or
    if the CCD's are warming up and generating dark current.
    There can also be a scattered light contribution just from a very
    bright sky, or if there are very bright objects on some fibers that
    are scattering or bleeding light across the CCD.
<LI><B>Too few sky fibers to model sky-sub variance</B> <BR>
    There are not enough good sky fibers on the CCD.  This will only happen
    if for some reason there were far fewer than the mandated 16 sky fibers
    on a CCD, or most of those fibers just happened to be dead fibers.
    You should never see this message.
<LI><B>Large flexure flat<->science</B> <BR>
    There is a large shift (more than 0.15 pix) between the flat-field and
    the science exposure, presumably from flexure in the spectrographs.
    When this happens, another set of flat-fields (post-calibs) is
    recommended.  (However, don't bother to take a set of calibrations
    on a different night.  The Spectro-2D reductions never use calibrations
    from one night for science exposures on another.)
<LI><B>Bad sky residuals at ....</B> <BR>
    There is very poor sky-subtraction of the sky fibers at these wavelengths.
    This means that, somehow, there is excess light that varies across the
    plate.  This could be due to a light source near the telescope, or
    possibly a bright, non-uniform sky.
<LI><B>Red Monster at ....</B> <BR>
    This warning is triggered if we see bad sky residuals (above) that
    is specifically in the wavelength range of about 6400-6600 Ang.
    We think when this happens the handpaddle is still plugged in,
    in which case the observers should unplug it immediately.
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="outputs_log">Log files</A></H4>

<P>
If the reduction of an exposure is catastrophically bad, it may not
appear at all in the Son-of-Spectro table.  However, there should still
be a log file for this exposure on the sos.apo computer:
    <DL><DD><PRE>
    /data/spectro/spectrologs/$MJD/splog-$CAMERA-$EXPOSURE.log
    </PRE></DD></DL>
Reading this file should tell you what failed.  The first and last lines
of these files should contain "Started at" and "Finished at"
followed by timestamps.

<H4><A NAME="outputs_figure">S/N figures</A></H4>

<P>
A <B>median</B> signal-to-noise is computed for each object in the
wavelength ranges [4000,5500] Angstroms (synthetic g-band)
and [6910,8500] Angstroms (synthetic i-band).
We plot these S/N values versus the PHOTO fiber magnitudes, which were
measured in approximately a 3-arcsec diameter aperature (the same size
as our fibers).  If everything is working perfectly, then our S/N values
should correlate very well with these PHOTO magnitudes.

<P>
We determine whether a plate is "done" based upon the signal-to-noise
of the fainter objects on the plate.  We do this by fitting a line to
the (S/N)-vs.-magnitude plot in a specified wavelength range, then evaluating
this fit at g=20.2 mag (blue CCDs), and i=19.9 mag (red CCDs).
Approximately 10% of the main galaxy sample, 60% of the BRG's and 15% of
the QSO's are fainter than g=20.2.  Very few objects (1, 1, and 5%) are
fainter than i=19.9.

<P>
When the sky level is higher, we gain S/N more slowly at
the fainter magnitudes where we are sky-limited rather than photon-limited.
Without moon, we have typically found:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  log(S/N_g) = (zeropoint) - 0.31 * g
  log(S/N_i) = (zeropoint) - 0.31 * i
</PRE></DD></DL>
With partial moon, the slope steepens to -0.34 or worse.

<P>
The fitting regions are denoted on the plot with vertical dotted lines.
Arrows point to the evaluation of the fit on each of the 4 cameras, with
the top panels corresponding to the blue CCD's (synthetic g-band) and
the bottom panels corresponding to the red (synthetic r-band).
The thick blue line on the figure is only a meaningless, fixed reference line.

<P>
The right-hand figures plot the residuals of each object from the fit.
Symbol sizes on those right-hand plots indicate the magnitude of the
deviation from the fit line.  Symbol color is the same on the left
as on the right, so
<B><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">green</FONT></B>
objects have more flux and
<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">red</FONT></B>
ones less.
If the scale of the telescope is wrong, then you will see a radial drop-off
in flux (red points on the edge of the plate).
If you are observing too far over in air mass, then typically you correct
to first order with a scale change, but a quadropole is left in these
residuals.
If one spectrograph has problems, then this will show up as red points
in half of one of these figures.

<P>
Note that the (S/N)^2 totals listed in the table and the figure might
not exactly agree.  This is because the fitting to (S/N)-vs.-magnitude
is done on individual frames for the table, but on the summed S/N over
all frames for the figure.  The tabulated values are the ones we use
to declare a plate done.

<H2><A NAME="trouble">Trouble-shooting Son-of-Spectro</A></H2>

<P>
The Son-of-Spectro (SOS) reduction robot has proven to be quite robust.
However, if it appears to not be working one could check the following:
<OL>
<LI><B>Has a "loadCartridge" command been issued?</B><BR>
    If this has not been done from SOP, then there is no PLATE entry
    in the images.  This prevents SOS from reducing anything but bias
    and dark frames.
<LI><B>Is the cron job running?</B><BR>
    Log into "observer@sos.apo.nmsu.edu", and issue a "sos_status"
    command.  This should report that SOS is running.
    If not, then <A HREF="#launch">restart the cron job</A>.
<LI><B>Is the data being copied over?</B><BR>
    The raw data files should be copied from "sdsshost" to "sos.apo"
    in the /data/spectro/$MJD directory.  If it is not, then the disk
    may be full!  Or, the rsync command may not be working.
    This <B>could</B> be due to a rogue
    "aporsync" process sitting around.  The "sos_status" command will
    report any such processes.  If you suspect this as the
    problem, just kill that process.  It's a harmless thing to do, since
    SOS will just start it up again within a minute.
<LI><B>Are there old "lock" files sitting around?</B><BR>
    SOS generates "lock" files to prevent multiple processes from changing
    these files simultaneously.  The "sos_status" command will report
    all "lock" files and their last modification times.
    If any have been sitting around for several minutes or more,
    then something is wrong.  You should delete the file ending with ".lock".
    <B>However</B>, this could result in a corrupted "logfile*.fits".
<LI><B>Is anything amiss with running the scripts?</B><BR>
    Perhaps there is a communication problem between sdsshost.apo and sos.apo,
    or a problem running the code on sos.apo.  There is logging information
    written once per minute into the file
    <DL><DD><PRE>
    /data/spectro/spectrologs/sos.log
    </PRE></DD></DL>
    which may indicate such problems.
<LI><B>Is the logfile corrupted?</B><BR>
    This is probably the worst thing that could happen.  If the file
    <DL><DD><PRE>
    /data/spectro/spectrologs/$MJD/logfile-$MJD.fits
    </PRE></DD></DL>
    gets corrupted, then SOS will repeatedly crash.  One could just
    delete this file, which would basically wipe out all the previous
    reductions for that night from the web page.  Alternatively, one
    could delete all the raw and reduced data for that night from
    "sos.apo" (but not from sdsshost!!) :
    <DL><DD><PRE>
    % rm -rf /data/spectro/spectrologs/$MJD
    % rm -rf /data/spectro/$MJD
    </PRE></DD></DL>
    That might sound extreme, but SOS will simply start re-copying
    everything from "sdsshost" and re-build the reductions for the night.
    Obviously, this could take a couple of hours if its already late
    into the night.

<H2><A NAME="rereduce">Re-Reducing (Failed) Exposures</A></H2>

<P>
As of version v4_7_1, there is a mechanism to re-reduce exposures.
You may need to do this if a reduction failed, or the pre-calibs failed
and SOS could not reduce the science exposures.

<P>
To re-reduce all exposures for the current night:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % ssh sos.apo.nmsu.edu sos_redo
</PRE></DD></DL>
To re-reduce only exposures for plate 666:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  % ssh sos.apo.nmsu.edu sos_redo plate=666
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
Note that science exposures for a plate cannot be reduced until both
flat and arc exposures have been successfully reduced for that same plate.

<HR>

<p>This is from version $Name$ of procedures.<p>
